# 👑 The King's Table

**The King's Table** is a fantasy-themed chess game reimagined in the style of Hearthstone — where every move triggers an animated reaction, each piece has personality, and strategy meets spectacle.

> *“A game of minds, on a board of magic.”*

## 🎮 What is this?

**The King's Table** is an animated, interactive chess experience where:
- Each chess piece has its **own magical identity** (e.g. the Queen as a Fire Sorceress, the Knight as a Charging Beast)
- Every move triggers **animated spells, sounds, and visual effects**
- The board itself feels alive — like a **magical tavern table** in a fantasy universe

The aim is to **make chess feel dramatic and entertaining**, not just strategic.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Frontend**: React + Three.js (or Babylon.js) for 3D visuals  
- **Game Engine**: Custom move logic based on chess.js  
- **Animations**: Lottie / WebGL / Spine or Unity (if ported later)  
- **Audio**: Fantasy SFX for actions, environment (hearth, murmurs, tavern ambiance)  
- **Optional Multiplayer**: Firebase / WebSocket for PvP
